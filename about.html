        Hi everyone! I’m Aisyah (pronounced as aa-yee-sha). My friends call me
        Cya (like chia seeds), was born and raised in Malaysia and currently
        living in London, United Kingdom 🇬🇧 <br /><br />One of my personalities
        that I’m grateful for is the fact that I get bored easily. Seems like
        it’s my red flag but who I am now as a person is a result of my constant
        determination to never settle for less! When I was younger, I was doing
        quite well in my studies and life. Good grades, good friends and even
        lucky enough to get a scholarship! I felt like my potential wasn’t there
        yet so I decided to leave my family and friends to find inspiration in
        the UK. It was a huge step as I’ve never gotten the chance to travel
        outside of Malaysia before but I believe this decision was for the best.
        Fast forward to an amazing 4 years in Bristol, I finally got a degree in
        Mechanical Engineering! #WomenInSTEM <br /><br />Throughout my life, my
        hobbies change from time to time. My interests heavily depends on how I
        could monetise my hobbies (another red flag?), I’ve made and sold
        jewelleries, fake nails, bracelets and even started a crochet business!
        The first thing that goes in my head every time I see something pretty
        or nice is “Oh, I could probably do that” hence the constant change of
        hobbies. While in the search for a new hobby, I came across Tumblr again
        which reminded me how I used to edit HTML codes when I was younger to
        get the near perfect `grunge` aesthetic as my homepage. This sparked
        back my interest in programming as I feel like I want to make my own
        blog from scratch! This is where I discovered SheCodes and learnt all
        the languages that’s needed for a web developer. <br /><br />Going back
        to what I said earlier, I’m grateful I get bored easily. If not, I
        wouldn’t even thought to love programming and start my dream to become a
        Software Developer.
